# Olympic Lifting Weight Loader
Create's a program that generates a visual for the plates needed to load a given bar.

## Considerations
- [ ] Must have a toggle for mens bar and women's bar
- [ ] Clips vs competition clips
- [ ] Plates must be loaded properly
- [ ] Program must work with all numbers from empty bar to current world record clean and jerk + 5 kg for men and women
